## INTRODUCTION
---------------
The random password generator is a basic JS application that accepts a user's input for password length and criteria, and returns a password based off of the user's criteria. 

## REQUIREMENTS
--------------
N/A


## FUNCTIONALITY
----------------
Upon loading the page, the user will be met with a box that will provide their generated password, as well as a button reading "Generate Password".

Upon clicking the button, the user will be prompted to input the length of their desired password--between 8 and 128 characters. If their input does not fit 
this criteria, then an error will return. 

After designating their desired password length, the user will be prompted to select from 4 separate criteria: whether or not they want lowercase letters,
uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers. After selecting their criteria, the password will be generated.
